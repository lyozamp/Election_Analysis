# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. We calculated the total number of votes cast, got a complete list of candidates who received votes, calculated the total number of votes each candidate received, calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won and determined the winner of the election based on popular vote. During the challenge I was asked to further analysis the election data for the following list items. 
1.	Calculate the voter turnout for each county that voted in the congressional district.
2.	Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
3.	Determine which county had the largest turnout.
Below you will find the code used to find this information
## Resources 
-Data Source: election_results.csv

-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used – with some modifications – for any election by providing similar data for future elections so we can again compare counties, candidates and votes. In future elections we could change the script slightly to include the 2nd and 3rd place of the county turnout to see what order each counties turnout placed and do the same for the candidates and their placement in the running. In conclusion, this script will be very beneficial when comparing future election data!
